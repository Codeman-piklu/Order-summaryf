### What I learned
This project reinforced my understanding of:

- Using semantic HTML5 tags for better accessibility.

- Creating responsive and interactive designs with CSS.

- Applying hover effects for a more dynamic user experience.
Code Examples:

Here is an example of hover effects for the buttons:
- .primary_btn:hover {
  background-color: rgb(50, 16, 201);
  cursor: pointer;
  box-shadow: 0px 5px 10px rgb(7, 136, 136);
}

- .secondary_btn:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: black;
}

### Continued development
Continued Development
